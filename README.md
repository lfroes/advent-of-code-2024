# Advent of Code 2024
My Advent of Code 2024 solutions 

## Strategy

In this year I have decided to use three languages to solve the problems: TypeScript, Lua and GO. So i can learn more about these languages and improve my skills.
Each day will have a folder with the solutions for the problems using the three languages.
